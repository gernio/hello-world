    <h1 class='hello-world'> Nerd Nite St. Pete</h1>
  </body>
  <p> We all know that learning is more <strong> fun </strong> when you’re drinking with friends and colleagues. Nerd Nite strives for an educational yet salacious vibe. Several presenters totally geek out for 20 minutes each while guests drink and socialize - It’s like the Discovery Channel – with cocktails! Drink, learn, connect, and talk about fun, interesting stuff! </p>
